### 3D Printer

3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing (AM), refers to processes used to create a three-dimensional object in which layers of material are formed under computer control to create an object.Objects can be of almost any shape or geometry and are produced using digital model data from a 3D model or another electronic data source such as an Additive Manufacturing File (AMF) file. STL is one of the most common file types that 3D printers can read. Thus, unlike material removed from a stock in the conventional machining process, 3D printing or AM builds a three-dimensional object from computer-aided design (CAD) model or AMF file by successively adding material layer by layer.[For more information click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/3D_printing)

### Laser Cutter

Laser cutting is a technology that uses a laser to cut materials, and is typically used for industrial manufacturing applications, but is also starting to be used by schools, small businesses, and hobbyists. Laser cutting works by directing the output of a high-power laser most commonly through optics. The laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used to direct the material or the laser beam generated. A typical commercial laser for cutting materials would involve a motion control system to follow a CNC or G-code of the pattern to be cut onto the material. The focused laser beam is directed at the material, which then either melts, burns, vaporizes away, or is blown away by a jet of gas,[1] leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish. Industrial laser cutters are used to cut flat-sheet material as well as structural and piping materials.[For more information click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_cutting)

### Vinyl Cutter

Vinyl printing is a method of printing that is generally limited to a 1 colour print. The artwork is required in a vector format which is produced in a software package i.e. Adobe Illustrator or Corel Draw, this artwork format produces the design in lines as opposed to pixels as in a jpeg image. The artwork is sent in mirror image to the vinyl cutter, which is very much like a large printer, however instead of using ink it uses a blade. Once the image has been etched into the vinyl, the vinyl can then be removed from the cutter. The excess vinyl surrounding the image can be weeded (removed) from the backing sheet, once this has removed you will be left with your design.[For more information click here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinyl_cutter)

### CNC Router

CNC router (Or Computer Numerical Control router) is a computer-controlled cutting machine related to the hand held router used for cutting various hard materials, such as wood, composites, aluminium, steel, plastics, and foams. CNC stands for computer numerical control. CNC routers can perform the tasks of many carpentry shop machines such as the panel saw, the spindle moulder, and the boring machine. They can also cut mortises and tenons.A CNC router is very similar in concept to a CNC milling machine. Instead of routing by hand, tool paths are controlled via computer numerical control. The CNC router is one of many kinds of tools that have CNC variants.A CNC router is very similar in concept to a CNC milling machine.
